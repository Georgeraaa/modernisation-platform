## Patching for EC2s

You can use the [modernisation-platform-terraform-ssm-patching](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-ssm-patching) module to create[AWS SSM Patch Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-patch.html) resources in your account.

The module creates an s3 bucket for log storage, as well as maintnance windows, tasks, resource groups, and patch baselines.

Please see the module for guidance on how to implement.
