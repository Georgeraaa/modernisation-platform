## Overview

Once your [environment](creating-environments.html) and [networking](creating-networking.html) have been created, now the fun begins and you can start building!

On environment creation, base [Terraform](https://terraform.io) resources are created for you in the [modernisation-platform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/) repository in the environments folder.

These resources are preconfigured with a backend, providers etc, all that you need to start adding in infrastructure such as EC2s or RDS databases.

## Creating new resources

1. `git clone` the Modernisation Platform environments repository: `git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments.git`
1. Create a new Terraform files or resources in your application folder under `environments/`
1. Create a pull request

Currently the Modernisation Platform team will need to approve the pull request and manually deploy your infrastructure. But we plan to provide a pipeline for each application using Github actions to give you the power to approve and deploy your own infrastructure.
