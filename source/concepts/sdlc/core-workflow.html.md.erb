## Introduction

We use [trunk base development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development) in the Modernisation Platform, with all platform infrastructure stored in the [modernisation-platform](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform) repository.

## CI/CD

For our CI/CD pipelines we use [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

Workflow files are found [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/.github/workflows)
