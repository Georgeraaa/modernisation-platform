# <%= current_page.data.title %>

We currently have setup in our core-network account AWS Network Firewall to monitor and control network traffic on a layer 3 level for transit gateway connection and cross account VPCs to protect resources
such as EC2 instances, along with a general AWS resources

### What is an AWS network firewall

To learn more about AWS firewall please follow the links bellow

- [AWS Firewall](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/features/)
- [AWS Firewall Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNFknf9zyZg)

### Amending Rules

Rules can be amended by creating a pull request against the modernisation-platform repo and amending one of the following four file names from the core-network-services in the terrafrom environments folder.

- [development_rules.json](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/core-network-services/development_rules.json)
- [test_rules.json](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/core-network-services/test_rules.json)
- [preproduction_rules.json](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/core-network-services/preproduction_rules.json)
- [production_rules.json](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/core-network-services/production_rules.json)

The rules files are broken down by environment and not account to make it easier to keep track of changes, see below our CIDR ranges to help with forming new rules.

- [CIDR Ranges](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/cidr-allocation.md)

Rules are made up of a rule description and an action which would either be the DROP, PASS or ALERT, which would block, allow or monitor traffic based on the source IP or CIDR range then a destination IP or CIDR range, the port number is required next finally the protocol used. This can be IP or UPD.
Thes rules are formated in json format and a text example is shown bellow.

```
"<Descriptive name>": {
    "action": "<DROP,PASS, ALERT ",
    " source_ip ": " cidr ip>",
    "destination_ip": "<destination cidr ip>",
    "destination_port": "<port to allow but can also ne ANY>",
    "protocol": "<can be IP or UDP "
  }
```

  To add a rule to the AWS network firewall start by pulling down the latest copy of the repo using git pull then create a new branch, then copy and paste the above code snippet in to the appropriate Json file for the environment you are dealing with.

  Changing the details for the description and other fields in the code snippet to their appropriate values.

  Once this is complete save and commit your change and then do a git push to the repo to create a pull request for the modernisation platform team to review.

### Example

Below is an example of PR of how add rules. In this example there is one additional rule to be added for the network firewall.
