## Accessing Instances

For most EC2 running modern Linux operating systems, [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell_Protocol) access will be via [AWS Systems Manager Session Manager (SSM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html).

This provides secure and auditable access to EC2s without the need to expose ports or use a bastion. This can also be used for port forwarding to access private web consoles, [RDS databases](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) or Windows [RDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol).

## Bastions

For instances running older versions of Linux where the [SSM Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html) can't be installed, we can provide a [bastion host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host).

The bastion will be preconfigured with the relevant security and network connectivity required.
You can then securely connect to this bastion host via Systems Manager, and then on to your instance.

## How to connect
For information on how to connect to instances or Bastions see [Accessing EC2s](../../user-guide/accessing-ec2s.html).
