## Public Certificates

All environments can create their own public certificates using [AWS Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html).

## Private Certificates

We provide a [Private root Certificate Authority (CA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html) in the [network services account and VPC](networking-approach.html#other-vpcs), along with subordinate production and non production CAs.

The subordinate CA's are then shared to the application environments via a [RAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html) share (either production or non production depending on the environment).

Certificates can then be created using the Private subordinate CA, the certificates remain local to the application environment.
