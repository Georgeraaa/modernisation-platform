In the Modernisation Platform repository, we have some [useful scripts](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/scripts) for common things for working on the Modernisation Platform.

## General scripts

### [`check-environment-definitions.js`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/scripts/check-environment-definitions.js)

Used as part of a CI/CD pipeline? ✅

This script is run via the [check-environment-definitions.yml workflow](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/check-environment-definitions.yml) when a JSON file is added or changes in the `/environments` directory and a PR is subsequently created. It checks that the JSON file includes required tags and comments on the PR if there's an issue.

### [`create-accounts.sh`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/scripts/create-accounts.sh)

Used as part of a CI/CD pipeline? ✅

This script is run via the [create-accounts.yml workflow](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/create-accounts.yml) when a PR is merged into `main` that has a new environment definition. It runs the Terraform to create the environment.


### [`create-per-account-local-workspaces.sh`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/scripts/create-per-account-local-workspaces.sh)

Used as part of a CI/CD pipeline? ❌

This can be run to create local environment directories and their subsequent remote Terraform workspaces. The output is the subdirectories in [`terraform/environments/`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/environments)

### [`utilities.js`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/scripts/utilities.js)

Used as part of a CI/CD pipeline? ✅

Used as part of `check-environment-definitions.js`.

## Internal scripts

### [`internal/loop-through-bootstrap-workspaces-and-plan.sh`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/scripts/internal/loop-through-bootstrap-workspaces-and-plan.sh)

Used as part of a CI/CD pipeline? ❌

This script shouldn't be run as part of a CI/CD pipeline as it may leak secrets. It can be run locally to check each account has been correctly bootstrapped, or to see what is going to be created across all environments if you add a new resource to the bootstrap file. It is in the `internal` subdirectory to separate it from publicly runnable scripts.

### [`internal/upgrade-terraform-providers.sh`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/scripts/internal/upgrade-terraform-providers.sh)

Used as part of a CI/CD pipeline? ❌

This script looks for any directory that holds a `*.tf` file, unless it's a `.terraform` directory or is the `templates/` directory, and runs `terraform init -upgrade` within the directories.

It's useful for bulk-updating all of the Terraform providers and modules in one go. The `.terraform.lock.hcl` files that are part of this PR is a sample of what files are generated by Terraform when this script is run.
