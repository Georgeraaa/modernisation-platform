# Introduction

The purpose of this document is to show contributors to the modernisation platform code the best practises and testing that should be undertaken. Code should be in Terraform and tests, if coded, in Go.

# Coding examples

There are a number of examples in this repository of coding and also addutional ones in the modernisation-platform-environments repository. One are we recommend users exmaine is the example code in moderisation-platform-environments/terrafor/environments//example area. This has sameples of code showing how to build and ec2, security groups, load blanacnders, rds and others. These are named well and the code can be copied and pasted into your own code so they are available locally. Obviously when these are copied the names should be changed so they do not contain the example names.
