# Modernisation Platform modules

This directory contains modules that the Modernisation Platform team have written for internal testing before wider use. Once a module is mature enough, it will be moved to its own repository, like [modernisation-platform-terraform-baselines](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-baselines).
